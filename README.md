# Police-Killings-in-the-US

This is a data visualization project I worked on in the summer of 2018. It analyzes the socioeconomic variables of victims killed by the police. 

I have included shape files, longitudinal data, and a writeup on insights developed about the victims. This code is from 538's project "The Counted", which logs the identities and demographics of police killing victims.
